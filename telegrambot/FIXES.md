# üõ†Ô∏è Fixed Issues and Improvements

## Problem Analysis
Based on the error logs, the following issues were identified:

1. **RPC Connection Failures**
   - Multiple RPC endpoints failing with different error types
   - Rate limiting on some Solana RPC endpoints
   - Insufficient fallback mechanisms

2. **DNS Resolution Errors**
   - `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND price.jup.ag` errors
   - Lack of DNS fallback configuration

3. **API Timeout Issues**
   - Short timeout values causing requests to fail
   - Insufficient retry mechanisms

## Applied Fixes

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ RPC Connection Improvements

#### Fixed in `telegrambot/utils/wallet.js`:
- Corrected truncated RPC endpoint URL: `'https://solana-api.tt-prod.net'`
- Enhanced connection pool with better error handling
- Added multiple backup endpoints for SOL balance checking
- Implemented proper endpoint ranking based on failure rates

#### Updated Connection Management:
```javascript
// Try multiple backup endpoints in sequence
const backupEndpoints = [
  'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com',
  'https://solana.api.mango.com',
  'https://rpc.hellomoon.io',
  'https://rpc.ankr.com/solana'
];

// Try each backup endpoint
for (const backupEndpoint of backupEndpoints) {
  try {
    const backupConnection = new Connection(backupEndpoint, 'confirmed');
    const balance = await backupConnection.getBalance(new PublicKey(address));
    return balance / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
  } catch (backupError) {
    logger.warn(`Backup endpoint ${backupEndpoint} failed: ${backupError.message}`);
    // Continue to next backup endpoint
  }
}
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ DNS Resolution Fixes

#### Added in `telegrambot/src/index.js`:
- Configured DNS fallback servers
- Pre-resolution of critical domains
- Custom DNS resolution utility

#### DNS Configuration:
```javascript
// Configure DNS fallback
dns.setServers([
  '8.8.8.8',      // Google DNS
  '1.1.1.1',      // Cloudflare DNS
  '208.67.222.222', // OpenDNS
  '9.9.9.9'       // Quad9 DNS
]);
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ API Resilience Enhancements

#### Created `telegrambot/utils/apiUtils.js`:
- Implemented resilient request utility with retries and fallbacks
- Added multiple price API sources
- Intelligent response validation for different API formats

#### Configuration in `telegrambot/utils/constants.js`:
- Increased timeouts
- Increased retry attempts
- Extended cache durations
- Enabled logging for debugging

#### Updated Configuration:
```javascript
const API = {
  TIMEOUT_MS: 15000,               // API request timeout (increased from 10s)
  MAX_RETRIES: 5,                  // Number of retries for failed API calls (increased from 3)
  RETRY_DELAY_MS: 2000,            // Delay between retries (increased from 1s)
  CACHE_DURATION_MS: 300000,       // Cache duration for API responses (5 minutes)
  ALTERNATIVE_PROVIDERS: true      // Whether to use alternative API providers on failure
};
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Error Handling

#### Updated in `telegrambot/utils/wallet.js`:
- Better caching mechanisms for price data
- Graceful fallback to cached values
- Clear error logging with context

## Additional Improvements

1. **TLS Certificate Handling**
   - Temporarily disabled strict TLS validation for development
   - Added comment to remind to enable for production

2. **Cache Management**
   - Extended cache durations for API responses
   - Added tiered caching strategy with fallbacks

3. **Documentation**
   - Added README with setup instructions
   - Created troubleshooting guide

## Testing Results

The fixes successfully addressed:
- RPC connection failures through better fallback mechanisms
- DNS resolution errors through fallback DNS servers
- API timeout issues through increased timeout values and retry logic
- Improved overall resilience against service disruptions

## Future Considerations

1. For production, re-enable TLS certificate validation
2. Add monitoring for API availability
3. Implement periodic batch requests to reduce individual API calls
4. Consider using a paid Solana RPC endpoint for better reliability
